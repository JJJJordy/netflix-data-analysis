# Netflix Movies & TV Shows - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset** to uncover how the platform’s catalog has evolved over time.  
Using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, I clean and analyze the dataset to identify growth trends, genre distributions, and audience targeting patterns.
